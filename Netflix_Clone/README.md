# Netflix Style site

This site was produced to mimic the appearance of Netflix home page.
It contains a header with a menu, a Hero section with the selected or featured "film" or "serie" and a Carousel with the "available series".

The HERO image background was designed by Rafael Nishikawa and used with permission.
The cover images, for the carousel, were retrieved using Google Image Search with the filter for "Creative Commons by nc".

This repository has no commercial intentions and is only available to present the skills of this account owner.
